Hereâ€™s a solid OOP-based project idea for your C/C++ class:

Project: Library Management System (CLI-based)
Concept:
A simple Library Management System where users (students and librarians) can:

Add, remove, and search for books.

Borrow and return books.

View borrowed books and due dates.

Handle multiple users with different roles.

OOP Concepts Used:
âœ… Classes & Objects â€“ Books, Users, Librarian, Student
âœ… Encapsulation â€“ Private data members for book details & user info
âœ… Inheritance â€“ Student and Librarian inheriting from User
âœ… Polymorphism â€“ Different implementations for viewing book details (Admin vs Student)
âœ… File Handling â€“ Store book and user data persistently

Class Structure (C++ Example)
cpp
Copy
Edit
class Book {
private:
    string title, author, isbn;
    bool isAvailable;
public:
    Book(string t, string a, string i);
    void displayDetails();
    bool borrowBook();
    void returnBook();
};

class User {
protected:
    string name, userID;
public:
    User(string n, string id);
    virtual void viewBooks() = 0;  // Polymorphism
};

class Student : public User {
public:
    void viewBooks() override;
    void borrowBook(Book &b);
};

class Librarian : public User {
public:
    void viewBooks() override;
    void addBook();
    void removeBook();
};
Extensions:
ðŸ”¹ Implement file handling to store book/user data.
ðŸ”¹ Add authentication for users.
ðŸ”¹ Track borrowing history.
